# ShadowLife

#### The purpose of this project is to: 

    • Gain experience working with an object-oriented programming language (Java) using OOP principles. 

    • Introduce fundamental game programming concepts (2D graphics, timing, geometric calculations) 

    • Gain experience writing software using an external library (Bagel)

#### Description of the simulation

Shadow Life is a graphical simulation of a world inhabited by creatures called gatherers. 
Their purpose in life is to gather fruit from the trees, and deposit them at stockpiles. Once they have gathered all the fruit from their trees, they rest in front of fences.

Making their life dificult is the thief who aims to steal fruit from the stockpiles
 and place it in their hoards. The thief and gatherers follow rigid rules, 
and once they all reach their final goals (the fence), the simulation halts. 

They are quite industrious workers, with enough time, they could calculate anything that any computer can!

#### Run the simulation 
    • Clone repository 
    • Open in IntelliJ or any other IDE you use for Java as a project
    • Add bagel.jar file under "lib" folder as project library 
    • Run the ShadowLife.java file to view the simulation
    • Optional: To view the simulation in a different world (provided in res/worlds folder): 
        • Open args.txt file 
        • Replace 'product' with desired world 
        • Save 
        • Run ShadowLife.java
