# ShadowLife
A life simulation I created using Java and the Bagel GUI library. This was the semester long assignment for Object Oriented Software Development (SWEN20003) unit.

The initial commit is the exact copy of the version I submitted for assessment. 
But before the final exam I redesigned some of the files using advanced data structures and OOP principles I didn't use previouly.
